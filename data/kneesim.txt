mask - 2D zero-one mask of foreground and background
proton - estimate of proton density of each pixel
T2est - estimate of T2 value of each pixel
T2vals - sorted and unique list of estimated T2 values from T2est

you should work with the masked values, e.g. 
imshow( T2est * 1000 * mask )
imshow( proton * mask )
